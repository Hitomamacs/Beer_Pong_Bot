# Beer_Pong_Bot

## Overview:
The main idea is to build an autonomous robot to play  the game of [BeerPong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_pong).
We can divide the project in 3 main stages:
1. Hardware design
2. Software design
3. Testing
---

### Hardware:
We'll gonna use a 1 axis robot with another dereee of not motorized in the y direction. All of the pieces are gonna be 3d Printed. A rotary table with a stepper motor will be used to control the movement along one of the axis. The mechanism to throw the ball will be implemented using 2 dc motors controlled by an arduino. These otors will be placed adjacent to the cannon and will transfer the angular velocity to the ball. The cannon will also have an auto-reloding mechanism for throwing more balls successively.
